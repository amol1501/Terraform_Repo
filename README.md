🌍 Terraform Repository

🚀 Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure efficiently. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables declarative management of cloud resources.

📌 Features

Modular Infrastructure – Easily reusable and scalable modules.

Multi-Cloud Support – Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

State Management – Tracks infrastructure changes via Terraform state.

Automation & CI/CD – Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments.

Security & Compliance – Follow best practices for secure infrastructure.
